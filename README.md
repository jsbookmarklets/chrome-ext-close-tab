Close tab by double right clicking anywhere on the page. Inspired by "Rights To Close" extension for Mozilla Firefox.

Close the active tab by double right clicking anywhere on the page.

You might want to provide permissions to "Allow in incognito" and "Allow access to file URLs". If required, you can do this by going to "chrome://extensions/".

Close Tab by Double Right Click implements an alternative approach for closing "chrome:///", "about:blank" and other special tabs. This is due to technical limitations of Chrome API. In these tabs, you would find a "Close Tab" context-menu entry which is shown when you right click anywhere on the page.

The idea of this extension is inspired by "Rights To Close" extension for Mozilla Firefox.
